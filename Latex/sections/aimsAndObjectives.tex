\chapter{Aims and Objectives}

\section{Aims}
The \ac{AHP} is a phenomenon in which those with higher \ac{SES} experience less overall harm from alcohol consumption over their lifetime than those with lower \ac{SES}, despite consuming greater quantities of alcohol. \ac{ABM} has been used to try to understand the paradox within a framework informed by a social theory known as  \ac{FCT}. This project aims to replicate an existing \ac{ABM} and critically explore the extent to which it can reproduce the \ac{AHP}.


\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Core Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}%[leftmargin=\labelsep]
    \item Understand the \ac{AHP}, \ac{FCT} and the wider context of ABM's within public health research. 
    \item Develop \ac{UML} design documents to represent the existing \ac{FCT}-based ABM. 
    \item Use the \ac{UML} design to develop a replica ABM in \ac{RHPC}. 
    \item Develop a range of experiments to explore the ABM and its dynamic behaviour. 
    \item Implement experiments and analyse the ability of the \ac{ABM} to reproduce the \ac{AHP}.

\subsection{Stretch Goals}
\\
\\
    \item Critically appraise the \ac{ABM} as an adequate representation of \ac{FCT} within the context of \ac{AHP}. 
    \item Propose modifications or enhancements to the \ac{ABM} already in use to better represent \ac{FCT}. \end{enumerate}

Currently, there exist 10000 yaml files in the experiment folder.

WARNING: The following code will delete all previous simulation csv data in Data_Procsiing/outputs, as well as in FCT_Model/outputs
Are you sure you want to run the model with 10000 the yaml files in the test_parameters folder? (y/n): Deleting all the csv files in the FCT_Model/outputs folder!
